# The Nexus

**Version 3.0** — Origin Arc Edition. An immersive RPG engine powered by Claude — your AI Game Master for genre-flexible, consequence-driven adventures.

## What's New in 3.0

### Origin Arc System
- **4 Character Tiers**: Origin, Journeyman, Veteran, Legend — each with distinct skill budgets, entry styles, and gameplay feel
- **Origin Arc**: A guided 3-8 scene prologue for new characters that builds who they are before the main story
- **Cold Open** preserved for experienced characters (Tier 3-4 mandatory, Tier 2 optional)
- **Tier-adjusted difficulty**: DCs, skill caps, and advancement rates scale to character experience
- **Legacy Complications**: Tier 4 (Legend) characters carry narrative weight — debts, enemies, promises

### Narrative Architecture Engine
- **Story Spine Tracking**: Every scene connects through status quo → disruption → choice → new status quo
- **Dramatic Question Engine**: Each arc has a core question shaping choices, NPC behavior, and resolution
- **Thematic Thread Registration**: Emergent themes woven into environment, dialogue, and choice framing
- **Scene Tension Curve**: Every scene must move — entry tension ≠ exit tension
- **Breath Protocol**: Mandated quiet beats after 2-3 high-tension scenes
- **Contrast Pulse**: Strategic prose style breaks every 5-7 responses for human-feeling narration

### NPC Arc Engine
- **Tension Axis**: NPCs have internal conflicts that shift based on PC actions
- **Progressive Revelation**: Secrets discovered through play, not exposition
- **Dialogue Fingerprinting**: NPCs identifiable by voice alone

### Enhanced Continuity (Archive & Trim v2)
- **Rolling Summary**: Character sheets consolidated into one coherent document (not stacked appendages)
- **Causal Chain**: Tracks *why* things are the way they are, not just what
- **Campaign Chronicle**: Append-only timeline persisting across all archives
- **Smart Trim**: Finds natural scene breaks near your requested trim point
- **Bridge Context**: Auto-generated "Previously..." message connecting archive to remaining conversation
- **Summary Quality Choice**: Quick (Haiku) or Deep (Sonnet) summary generation
- **Reference Doc Awareness**: Summary generation knows which game rules/playbooks are in play

## Features

### Core System
- **Nexus Framework v3.0**: Complete RPG system with tiered character creation, narrative architecture, and prose calibration
- **13 World States**: Dystopian, Utopian, Frontier, Balanced, Chaos, Decadent, Occupied, Gilded, Liminal, Enclave, Noir, Dying, Mythic
- **Dynamic State Shifts**: World states blend, shift, and rupture based on your actions
- **Player Agency Protection**: Multiple redundant safeguards prevent AI from narrating your character's actions

### Technical Features
- **📚 Reference Documents**: Upload playbooks, rules, maps (supports .txt, .md, .pdf)
- **Prose Calibration Engine**: Fine-tune writing style with author references and density controls
- **Character Sheet Continuity**: Persistent tracking with rolling summary consolidation
- **Save/Load Sessions**: Pick up any campaign where you left off
- **Model Selection**: Claude Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (up to 3.1 Pro), and OpenAI (GPT-5.2, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-4o)
- **Temperature Control**: Dial creativity up for wild sessions, down for consistency
- **Mobile Server**: Play on your phone while running locally on desktop
- **Dark UI**: Easy on the eyes for marathon sessions

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install customtkinter anthropic PyPDF2 --break-system-packages

# Optional: for Google AI support
pip install google-generativeai --break-system-packages

# Optional: for OpenAI support
pip install openai --break-system-packages
```

### 2. Set your API key

```bash
# Linux/Mac: add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"

# Optional: for Google AI
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key-here"

# Optional: for OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

Or just run the app — it'll prompt you for the key on first message.

### 3. Run

```bash
python storyteller.py
```

### 4. Begin

Type `Begin` to start a new session. The Nexus will guide you through:
1. World State selection (13 options with blending support)
2. Genre selection (Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.)
3. Optional prose style calibration
4. **Character Tier selection** (Origin, Journeyman, Veteran, Legend)
5. Character creation with tier-appropriate skill point distribution
6. **Origin Arc** (Tier 1-2) or **Cold Open** (Tier 2-4) — your story begins

## Character Tiers

| Tier | Name | Skill Budget | Skill Range | Entry Style | Example |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Origin** | 15 points | -2 to +5 | Origin Arc (default) | Farm boy, raw recruit, untrained Force-sensitive |
| 2 | **Journeyman** | 27 points | -2 to +7 | Origin Arc or Cold Open | Padawan, seasoned merc, junior detective |
| 3 | **Veteran** | 36 points | -2 to +9 | Cold Open (mandatory) | Jedi Knight, master thief, spec-ops |
| 4 | **Legend** | 45 points | -2 to +9 | Cold Open + Legacy Complication | Jedi Master, Sith Lord, galactic crime boss |

### Tier-Adjusted Gameplay
- **Difficulty**: DCs scale with tier (Tier 1: forgiving 10-15, Tier 4: legendary 18-25)
- **Advancement**: Origin Arc characters level faster; Legends grow in depth, not numbers
- **Skill Caps**: Tier 1 caps at +5 during Origin, rising to +7 after. Tier 3-4 cap at +9.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |

## Archive & Trim (v2)

The enhanced Archive & Trim system maintains continuity across long campaigns:

### Rolling Summary
Instead of stacking session summaries, the system generates a **single consolidated character sheet** that merges new content with existing data. Outdated information is updated, not preserved.

### Smart Trim
Instead of cutting at an arbitrary message count, the system finds a **natural scene break** near your requested trim point — scene transitions, choice prompts, or time skips.

### Bridge Context
After trimming, a **"Previously..."** message is generated to connect the archived content to the remaining conversation.

### Summary Quality
Choose between:
- **Quick** (Haiku): Fast, cheaper — good for routine trims
- **Deep** (Sonnet): Better continuity preservation — recommended for complex campaigns

### Character Sheet Format
The consolidated sheet includes:
1. **Narrative Lens** — Voice, tension, pacing, thematic threads, dramatic questions
2. **Technical Continuity** — Hard facts, tier, skills, NPCs, inventory
3. **Sensory Snapshot** — Where the scene was cut, physical details
4. **Active Micro-Dynamics** — NPC internal states, tension axes, secrets, dialogue fingerprints
5. **Golden Moments** — Prose style anchors from the session
6. **Causal Chain** — How decisions led to current state
7. **Open Loops** — Immediate, short-term, and long-game threads
8. **Campaign Chronicle** — Append-only timeline of major events

## In-Game Commands

- **"Veil this"** — Pull back from explicit content
- **"Nexus, Pause"** — Halt the scene entirely
- **"Rewind"** — Reset to before a failed choice
- **"Nexus, show naming convention"** — See current cultural naming rules
- **"Nexus, adjust prose: [style]"** — Change writing style mid-session
- **"Read the room"** — Get current state analysis
- **"What would shift this?"** — Query world state destabilization triggers

## Temperature Guide

- **0.3-0.5**: Tight, consistent, predictable — good for mechanical/rules-heavy sessions
- **0.7-0.8**: Reliable characterization with room to breathe
- **0.9** : Slightly more creative, occasional surprises
- **1.0** (default, max): Full creative range — best for narrative-heavy play

## Anti-Railroading Safeguards

The Nexus respects player agency with multiple protections:

- ✅ Stops after describing situations (never assumes PC actions)
- ✅ Never narrates "you feel/think/decide" without player input
- ✅ Explicit checkpoints in combat and social scenes
- ✅ Concrete examples of violations in framework

If the AI ever railroads: **"Stop. You're narrating my character's actions. Let me decide."**
